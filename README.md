# MSCS532_Project_SEO
This repo is SEO Project for MSCS532 (Algorithm and Data Struture) course
## File seo.py
seo.py is the partial implementation of the project. Here, I have done the Document and InvertedIndex class. Next, I will implement PriorityQueue, and there might be some other features to complete this project.
